# OIBSIP-Intern
 During my initial Oasis Infobyte internship, I created some web project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This experience amplified my coding skills and provided hands-on insight into blending design with interactivity. My project showcased how these technologies converge to form a cohesive and engaging user experience.
